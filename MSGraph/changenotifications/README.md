# Handle Change Notifications with Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph enables developers to consume user information stored in Microsoft 365 in custom applications. 

Change notifications feature enable applications to be alerted when data is created or changed in Microsoft Graph. When a particular entity is created, updated, or changed, Microsoft Graph submits an HTTP POST to the specified custom endpoint. Your custom endpoint listens for these messages and acts on them based on the logic defined by your business requirements.
